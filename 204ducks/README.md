# 204ducks

When ducks are disturbed by a sudden noise, they fly away almost simultaneously, leaving the pond empty.
This algorithm will compute and display the following, given the value of a:

1. The average time after which ducks come back,
2. The standard deviation of the ducks’ return time,
3. The time after which 50% of all of the ducks are back,
4. The time after which 99% of all of the ducks are back,
5. The percentage of ducks that come back after 1 minute,
6. The percentage of ducks that come back after 2 minutes.

Where a is a real constant between 0 and 2.5, which depends on external factors (such as temperature, daytime, duck’s health etc...).
