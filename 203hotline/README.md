# 203hotline

Algorithm that allow you to calculate the probability of an overload (that is, the probability of no line being available) for a 25-phone hotline, depending on the average duration of calls.

* USAGE
   - ./203hotline n [k | d]

* DESCRIPTION
   - n     n value for the computation of C(n, k)
   - k     k value for the computation of C(n, k)
   - d     average duration of calls (in seconds)

## Bonus

The bonus is like the initial algorithm but you can choose how many phone the hotline got.

Consider p the number of phone.

* USAGE
   - ./203hotline p n [k | d]
